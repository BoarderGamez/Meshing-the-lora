# Meshing the LoRa
This is a compact LoRa puck for all your needs such as meshtastic. I made this because I'm on my way to getting my ham radio licence and I thought this would be a cool accompanying thing. (also meshtastic is peak)
## Where did this name come from?
I intend to use it for meshtastic so I thought of this name!
